## Early Stage Startups

*We can help you figure out a strategy to move your company forward.*

We will help you find affordable strategies to gather information about your target market and reach out to potential users. You'll also get a plan on how to test your value prop, with a super low tech MVP, and we'll help you determine the right tech to move forward from your MVP.

If you have already tested your market, we can help you plan your tech stack, development process, and help you determine what the best infrastructure and services would be for your company. We'll give you an outside perspective on the best way to move your product forward.
