## Early Stage Startups

*I can help you figure out a strategy to move your company's tech forward.*

Have you already started to figure out your market, but aren't sure how to start testing your product? I'll help you build a plan to test your assumptions with a super low tech MVP. I'll set you up with the appropriate technologies to gather data from your MVP users and help you determine the right technologies to move forward from there.

If you have already have a basic MVP, I can help you refine it and move your tech to the next level. If you need help figuring out the right infrastructure and deployment strategies, I can help you out.

## Other Projects

Do you have an idea for an app or website that you want to bring to fruition but aren't sure where to start?

Let me know.

I'll help you determine what resources will be necessary for your project. I'll evaluate the best technologies for you, figure out what kind of people, if any, you'll need to hire, find the appropriate infrastructure on which to deploy your project, and lay out a plan for you to move forward.
