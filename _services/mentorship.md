    ### Learn how to build your product 
    
    Do you want to learn how to build it all yourself, instead of paying someone else to do it? We might be putting ourselves out of business by doing this, but we will gladly teach you how it's done!
    
    We believe in education, and we like helping out our community, so come find RaphaÃ«l on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/raphaeltm) to learn how it's done.
driftMsg: I can help you learn what you need! Get in touch to schedule a 1-on-1 session through Codementor.

**...by teaching you how to build great web and mobile apps.**

I can teach you how to build web sites, web apps, and mobile apps using a number of technologies, but what I like to focus on is building and deploying Python applications on Amazon's AWS infrastructure.

I can teach you how to build APIs to make your data accessible to mobile apps, how to build cross platform applications with tools like Ionic, or FuseTools (soon), and how to create a beautiful, static website (like this one) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and static site generators like Jekyll, or Pelican.

There's more I can teach you too, just get in touch by <a href="#" class="drift-open-chat" data-msg="What would you like to learn?">clicking this link</a> or the button below and we'll see if I can help you out!
