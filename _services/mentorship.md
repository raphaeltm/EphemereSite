    ### Learn how to build your product 
    
    Do you want to learn how to build it all yourself, instead of paying someone else to do it? We might be putting ourselves out of business by doing this, but we will gladly teach you how it's done!
    
    We believe in education, and we like helping out our community, so come find Raphaël on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/raphaeltm) to learn how it's done.
driftMsg: I can help you learn what you need! Get in touch to schedule a 1-on-1 session through Codementor.
