    ### Apps for everyone
    
    Come with an idea and I'll turn it into a cross-platorm app that will work on iOS and Android. I'll help determine the appropriate technologies to build your app, and the backend infrastructure to power it.

## iOS and Android

I build mobile apps using a variety of awesome technologies like React Native, Fuse, PhoneGap, or Xamarin, depending on what's best for you and your project. If you need completely native apps, I can get that done for you too.

## Super-Powered

If your app needs a backend to store data, files, authenticate users, or anything else, I'll either set you up with a platform to handle all of those requirements, or build a custom backend if that's what's necessary.
