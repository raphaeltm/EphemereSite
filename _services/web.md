## Do you need a website?

I can make one for you. And I can make it absolutely gorgeous. Or totally garish. Whatever you need.

If you need a website, I won't just set you up with my favourite tools. I will help you figure out out *the best platform to fit your needs* and set you up with that. Whether it's WordPress, a customzable CMS like <a href="https://prismic.io/">Prismic</a>, or something else, I'll make it happen for you.

If you need to setup an online store I can do that too, whether it's a [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) WordPress site, a [Moltin](https://www.moltin.com/)-driven site, or a completely custom solution.

If you need any branding work done, I'll work with our awesome partners at <a href="http://letspivot.com/">Pivot</a>.

## Do you need a web app?

I build web apps using a variety of technologies provided by industry giants, like [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/), and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/). I build beautiful interfaces, and performant applications that can do whatever you need them to do.

Do you need an MVP for your startup? Do you want to automate your business processes? Are you trying to build an online product?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, *I can help*.
