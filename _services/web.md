Interested in getting a new web app off the groud? Let's <a href="#" class="drift-open-chat" data-msg="What kind of web app do you want to build?">chat</a>!

## Not sure what the difference between a web app and a website is?

Essentially, if you primarily need the site to "show" stuff, like text, pictures, and video then you probably need a website!

If, however, you need a site where lots of people can log in, see some things, but not others, perhaps generate reports, manipulate information, and more, what you need is a web app.

You can think of most small blogs as "websites," and most big services, like Twitter, Pinterest, or Reddit, as web apps.

One way or another, we can build them for you! Just <a href="#" class="drift-open-chat" data-msg="Need a web app or website? Let me know!">get in touch!</a>
